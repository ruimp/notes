	abstract = {In this thesis we initiate a systematic study of branes in Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models with Lie supergroup target space. We start by showing that a branes' worldvolume is a twisted superconjugacy class and construct the action of the boundary WZNW model. Then we consider symplectic fermions and give a complete description of boundary states including twisted sectors. Further we show that the GL(1{\textbar}1) WZNW model is equivalent to symplectic fermions plus two scalars. We then consider the GL(1{\textbar}1) boundary theory. Twisted and untwisted Cardy boundary states are constructed explicitly and their amplitudes are computed. In the twisted case we find a perturbative formulation of the model. For this purpose the introduction of an additional fermionic boundary degree of freedom is necessary. We compute all bulk one-point functions, bulk-boundary two-point functions and boundary three-point functions. Logarithmic singularities appear in bulk-boundary as well as pure boundary correlation functions. Finally we turn to world-sheet and target space supersymmetric models. There is N=2 superconformal symmetry in many supercosets and also in certain supergroups. In the supergroup case we find some branes that preserve the topological A-twist and some that preserve the B-twist.},

	abstract = {In this note we analyze the geometry of maximally symmetric boundary conditions in Lie supergroup Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models. We ﬁnd that generically the worldvolume of a brane is a twisted superconjugacy class, very much like in the Lie group case. Whenever the brane is not completely delocalized in the fermionic directions a new atypical class of branes arises. We give an example of these new branes and show for type I supergroups and trivial gluing conditions that they can be naturally associated with atypical representations of the aﬃne Lie superalgebra.},
